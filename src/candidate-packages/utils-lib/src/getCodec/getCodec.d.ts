 * TODO make codec work on URLSearchParams - not just strings
 * WHY
 *  As-is we rely on URLSearchParams constructor to be in
 *  the round-trip of any decoding.
 *  This means the decode fn only partially does the decoding;
 *  it relies on the external use of URLSearchParams.
 *
 * WHEN
 *  A.S.A.P â€” its a simple refactor - unfortunately I had to
 *  abandon due to ruthless prioritization.

 * HOW
