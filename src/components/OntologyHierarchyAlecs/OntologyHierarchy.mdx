# OntologyHierarchy

OntologyHierarchy is a simple hierarchy menu which features in the ontology app.

**Basic Story**: there are 2 required props:

- **instanceId**: must be unique within the parent app
- **data**: complete hierarchical dataset

**Expand Element**: To expand the Element branch (if it exists in the dataset), set this to true

**Draggable**: To enable dragging, set isDraggable to true and pass in a dragEvent

**Clickable**: To enable clicking (which passes out the uri), set isClickable to true and pass in a clickEvent

**No Descendant Count**: The descendant count is automatically shown in brackets.  Disable it by setting this property to false.

**Base Key**: To start from a base further down in the hierarchy, pass in a BaseKey

*NB: if you pass in a BaseKey that does not have a matching id in the data the component will render the complete dataset*

**Filter Ids and Clickable**: To filter data to only show the hierarchy of defined ids, pass in filterIds.
If you set isClickable to true and pass in a clickEvent, then hierarchy uri's which are in filterIds will be clickable (and pass out the uri).

*NB: if filterIds is empty or undefined, the component will render the complete dataset\
NB: if you pass in an id which is not in the dataset, it will not be rendered.*
